## Week 2

### Overview
This week, you will be introduced to the process underlying literature reviews. You will learn about different types of literature reviews, explore various publication database platforms, and begin using Zotero and Covidence for managing your research.

### 1. Introduction to Literature Reviews

#### Tasks:
1. Read this article that outlines the literature review process: [SLR-1.pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/710hiakxcg8372yotcfel/SLR-1.pdf?rlkey=c6iws9ffguulg8se9cigy4ba6&st=y9jlb6t2&dl=0)

2. Research different types of literature reviews. Which type would be most appropriate for our research on Neuroarchitecture based on your initial literature search?
   - Hint: Refer to [Types of Review Explained](https://support.covidence.org/help/types-of-review-explained)

3. Develop search terms related to the review we want to conduct on Neuroarchitecture.

### 2. Publication Database Platforms

#### Available Search Engines:
- Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/
- Scopus: https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic
- Web of Science: https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/basic-search
- PubMed: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
- MEDLINE: https://www.medline.com/
- PsycINFO: https://psycnet.apa.org/search
- World Health Organization: https://www.who.int/data/collections
- ClinicalTrials.gov
- Embase
- CINAHL
- Central

Note: Dr. Kastner can help determine which platforms you have access to via GT.

#### Tasks:
1. Identify which platforms are most relevant for our research question based on the topics they cover.
2. Describe the types of studies/information that each of these platforms covers.
3. Conduct an initial search for literature related to Neuroarchitecture using these platforms.

### 3. Reference Management with Zotero

#### Task:
1. Add any relevant papers you find during your initial search to Zotero.
   - Instructions for adding Zotero to your browser: https://www.zotero.org/start

### 4. Introduction to Covidence

Covidence is the platform we will use for conducting the literature review. You should have received an invite with access to Covidence. Please check your emails.
Website: https://www.covidence.org/

#### Tasks:
1. Explore the Covidence website and answer the following questions:
   - What is Covidence?
   - Why should we use Covidence? What are some advantages of using this software?

2. Watch the introductory video: [Covidence 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg1rgfe4vdk)

3. Create a brief summary (can be bullet points) of:
   - Key takeaways from the presentation
   - Main features of the Covidence platform
